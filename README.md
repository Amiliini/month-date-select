# month-date-select
A not so pretty solution for a pre assignment:

"Create a form with two select  element. The user first selects month (Jan, Feb, Mar,..,Dec) and after the selection can select the day of month but the list is updated by the correct number of days (like 31 days in Jan 30 in April). You can omit the leap day in February."
